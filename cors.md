# CORS
* Stands for Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
* Using CORS, a server can explicitly allow some cross-origin requests while rejecting others

## To register/enable CORS we are going to use EnableCorsAttribute class and it takes three params.
* **Origins:** Here, we need to set Origins which means from which domain the requests will accept. If you have more than one domain, then you can set as comma separated. Additionally if you want any domain request to be accepted then use wild card as "*".
*  **Request Headers:** The Request header parameter specifies which Request headers are allowed. To allow any header set value to "*".
*  **HTTP Methods:** The methods parameter specifies which HTTP methods are allowed to access the resource. Use comma-separated values when you have multiple HTTP methods like "get,put,post". To allow all HTTP methods, use the wildcard value "*".
